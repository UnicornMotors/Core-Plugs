# Core-Plugs
Capt. CHAOS 3 months ago 30 year mechanic... the old school kind, currently fixing boats.   Unless that old IDI diesel is rotted out  don't try to glue anything to that block. Is just gonna fly off under pressure. Find a different style freeze plug or try driving it in with a big socket that matches the diameter of the hole. That way it doesn't deform and get to loose from beating it. You can also warm up the engine without coolant and put the new plug in the freezer for an hour before you try to put it in. When you do, the block expands and the plug shrinks a little, making it easier to get in and even tighter when it comes back to ambient temperature.  5   Capt. CHAOS Capt. CHAOS 3 months ago  @Unicorn Coin  next thing I would try, as simple as this sounds...  Red Loctite thread locker. Clean everything so that it's as if you were gonna eat from it. Bone dry, squeaky clean... load it all up with RED Loctite or better.   Those motors survive things I can't begin to describe... and I'm a GM guy... â€”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxZyzVXcMv4&amp;lc=UgwceabnOBKDVUQsYCt4AaABAg
